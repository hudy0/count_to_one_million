# Counting to One Million

This project demonstrates different approaches to counting to one million in Python, focusing on sequential, multiprocessing, and multithreading implementations.

## Sequential Implementation

The sequential implementation uses a single thread to count from 1 to 1 million sequentially.

## Multiprocessing Implementation

The multiprocessing implementation utilizes the `multiprocessing` module to create multiple processes, each responsible for counting a portion of the numbers. This approach achieves parallelism by distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores.

## Multithreading Implementation

The multithreading implementation employs the `threading` module to create multiple threads, each responsible for counting a portion of the numbers. This approach allows concurrent execution of threads within a single process, enabling parallelism.

Each implementation serves as a demonstration of different methods to achieve parallelism in Python, with multiprocessing and multithreading providing ways to leverage multiple CPU cores for improved performance. The choice between them depends on factors such as task complexity, hardware configuration, and desired trade-offs between performance and complexity.
